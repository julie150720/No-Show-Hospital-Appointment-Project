# No-Show-Hospital-Appointment-Project

In this project, we will investigate the No-show appointments dataset. This original dataset collects information from 110.527 medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of why patients do not show up for their appointment. This is a Kaggle competition, which can be found from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments

From the Data Visualization and Machine Learning methods, we have the following conclusions:

1. Age: Age is negatively correlated with the Missed Appointments, which means that the younger patients tend to miss the appointment more than old patients.
2. Scholarship: Patient with scholarship tends to miss the appointments more.
3. Chronic illness: Interestingly, patients with chronic illnesses such as Hypertension and Diabetes tend to miss the appointments more.
4. Handicapped: People without handicapped tend to miss the appointments more.
5. SMS Received: People who receive the SMS are more likely to miss the appointments.
6. Days: People tends to miss the appointments more if the duration from the scheduled date and the appointment date is longer.
7. Gender: Male are more likely to miss the appointment than female. This maybe because female are more health-concerned than male.
8. New Patient: Interestingly, the new patient tends to miss the appointment more than the established one.
9. Number of missed appointments: People are more likely to miss appointments if they used to do so previously.
