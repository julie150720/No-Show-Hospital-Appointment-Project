# No-Show-Hospital-Appointment-Project

In this project, we will investigate the No-show appointments dataset. This original dataset collects information from 110.527 medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of why patients do not show up for their appointment. This is a Kaggle competition, which can be found from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments
